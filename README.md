RoundTable: The Future of Domain-Based Networking
Introduction
In an era where digital connections shape careers and collaborations, most networking platforms fall short of providing truly meaningful and relevant connections. Existing platforms are either too broad—flooding users with unrelated contacts—or too niche, limiting exposure to diverse opportunities.

RoundTable disrupts this norm by offering a domain-based, expertise-driven networking platform where individuals connect not just by industry, but by specific skills and interests. Whether you’re a Software Engineer, a Musician, a Sportsperson, or an Entrepreneur, RoundTable helps you discover the right people for the right opportunities.

Why RoundTable?
🚀 Precision Networking: Connect based on shared expertise rather than generic professional titles.
🎯 Mentorship and Growth: A dynamic scoring system tracks mentor and mentee experiences.
🔎 Domain-Centric Discovery: Advanced search functionality filters users based on skill sets.
🌍 Future-Ready: A platform that adapts as new industries and technologies emerge.
The Problem
Current networking platforms are not designed for targeted, skill-based connections. Professionals looking for mentorship, project collaboration, or job opportunities often struggle with:

Generic Recommendations – Matches are often based on vague job titles rather than specific expertise.
Lack of Engagement Metrics – No way to measure how actively a person contributes to a domain.
Scattered Opportunities – Job seekers, freelancers, and project owners do not have a unified platform to discover and interact.
Limited Mentorship Mechanisms – No structured way to build meaningful mentor-mentee relationships.
Our Solution: RoundTable
RoundTable is a next-generation professional networking platform that structures connections based on domains and expertise levels rather than broad industries.

When a user registers, they define their professional category:

Student – Select degree, major, and university.
Employee – Define position, company, and years of experience.
Freelancer – List expertise, notable projects, and client base.
Additionally, users can select up to three areas of expertise or interest within our growing list of domains:

🌐 Supported Domains
Software Development – Connect with others based on languages, frameworks, and technology stacks.
Sports – Network with athletes, coaches, and sports analysts.
Music – Find musicians, producers, and composers.
Project Ideas – Share startup concepts and collaborate on innovative projects.
Jobs & Freelancing – Discover job openings and freelance gigs, or find the right talent for your needs.
Each user’s profile dynamically updates based on engagement, ensuring highly relevant connections.
